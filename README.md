File Management System â€“ Node.js, Express, Multer

Developed a robust backend system for managing file uploads and folder structures using Node.js, Express.js, and Multer. This project streamlines file handling on the server by enabling users to:

Dynamically create and manage folders via API endpoints.

Upload files into specific folders with proper validation.

Organize and store content in a scalable, maintainable directory structure.

Key Features:

Utilized Multer middleware for efficient handling of multipart/form-data.

Implemented RESTful APIs for file and folder operations.

Added comprehensive error handling for invalid paths, missing data, and server-side failures.

Ensured the backend is modular, maintainable, and easily extendable for features like file previews, downloads, and user authentication.

This project strengthened my understanding of backend architecture, Express routing, and real-world debugging techniques, especially around asynchronous file system operations and dynamic path handling.
